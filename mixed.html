		<p>
			Ferrets need a safe, clean, and spacious place to live. A large, multi-level cage is ideal, with solid floors (not wire) to protect their feet. The cage should include soft bedding such as fleece blankets or hammocks, because ferrets like to burrow and sleep in cozy spaces and they sleep deeply—often 14–18 hours a day..<br>
			Even if they have a cage, ferrets should not be confined all day. They need several hours of supervised free-roaming time outside the cage in a ferret-proofed room. This means blocking small holes, covering wires, and removing anything they could chew or swallow.<br>
			The cage should be cleaned regularly. Litter boxes (with paper-based or wood-pellet litter) should be placed in corners, as ferrets naturally choose corners for toileting. Food and water should be kept clean and refreshed daily.
		</p>

		Cage Requirements:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Size & Type: Choose a large, multi-level cage with solid floors (not wire mesh) to prevent sore feet.</li>
			<li>Placement: Keep the cage indoors in a room that’s temperature-controlled (ideally 15–24°C / 60–75°F). Ferrets are sensitive to extreme heat and cold.</li>
			<li>Bedding: Use soft, washable bedding like fleece blankets. Hammock beds are a preferable choice. Avoid cedar or pine shavings—they can harm respiratory systems. </li>
		</ul>
		

		
		<h2 class="heading-font"> Diet</h2>

		</div>
		
		<p>
		Ferrets are obligate carnivores, meaning they must eat meat-based foods to stay healthy. Their diet should be high in animal protein and fat, and very low in carbohydrates and fiber.<br>
		The easiest and safest option is a high-quality ferret-specific food with at least 30–40% protein and 15–20% fat. Ingredients should list meat as the first component. Fresh water must always be available, preferably in a heavy bowl rather than only a bottle.<br>
		Ferrets should not be fed fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, or sugary treats, as their digestive systems cannot process these properly. Occasional treats can include small amounts of cooked egg or meat-based treats made specifically for ferrets.
		</p>
		
		Avoid:
		
		<ul>
		
			<li> Fruits and vegetables </li>
			<li> Dairy (can cause diarrhea) </li>
			<li> Sugary or high-carb treats (can cause insulinoma risk) </li>
			<li> Grains, nuts, or seeds </li>

		</ul>
		
		<p>
		Raw Feeding (Optional):
		Some ferret owners choose raw feeding (e.g., raw meat, organs, bone). If you do this: Ensure a balanced, safe approach and handle raw meat safely. Discuss with a vet to reduce bacterial and nutritional risks.

		<h2 class="heading-font"> Physical Enrichment</h2>
		
		<p>
		Ferrets are energetic, curious, and playful animals that need daily physical and mental stimulation. Without enrichment, they can become bored or destructive.<br>
		Provide toys such as tunnels, balls, and soft toys they can drag or stash. Rotating toys every few days helps keep them interesting. Many ferrets enjoy digging, so a dig box filled with rice or shredded paper can be a great enrichment tool.<br>
		Daily interactive play is essential. Letting ferrets explore, chase toys, and interact with you helps keep them physically fit and mentally healthy. Most ferrets need at least 2–4 hours of active playtime outside their cage each day.
		
		</p>

		To keep interest high:

		<ul>
			<li> Rotate toys every few days </li>
			<li> Change the play area layout </li>
			<li> Introduce new objects or safe hiding places </li>
		</ul>
