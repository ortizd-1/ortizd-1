		<h4>Critter care was created to help the owners of critters and small animals to take proper care of their furry friends, so they can live more comfortable and longer lives. </h2>
		
		<p class="body-font">
			Taking care of pets is hard, but it's even more difficult when they are small critters, some smaller the palm of your hand.
			Many small animals or critters require strict diets and special living accomodations.
			We provide infomation on various different animals, and how to take care of them. 
			We discuss proper diets, different ways of physical enrichment, and appropriate accomodation for each critter.
